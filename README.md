# Media Colorizer
This repo contains the deployed version of image and video colorizer

The 'new_app.py' file is the streamlit code for getting the required UI for the execution.

To run this, open the cmd and type "streamlit run new_app.py"

I have 'colorizer.py' as the python file for image colorizer and 'deoldify_video_colorizer' as the python file for video colorizer.
